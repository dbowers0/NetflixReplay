# Netflix User Data API

The Netflix User Data API is a powerful tool that allows you to analyze Netflix viewing history and retrieve insightful user statistics. By providing a `netflixviewinghistory.csv` file as input, the API processes the data and offers endpoints to fetch information such as most watched shows, total minutes watched all time, and other user statistics.

## Features

- Data Processing: The API seamlessly processes the `netflixviewinghistory.csv` file, extracting relevant information about the user's viewing history. It performs efficient data parsing and aggregation to generate user statistics.

- Most Watched Shows: Retrieve the list of the user's most watched shows, ranked by the number of times they were viewed. This information helps to identify popular shows and preferences.

- Total Minutes Watched: Get the total number of minutes the user has spent watching Netflix across their viewing history. This statistic provides an overview of the user's overall engagement with the platform.

- User Statistics: Access additional user statistics, such as average watch time per session, favorite genres, binge-watching streaks, or any other relevant insights derived from the viewing history data.
